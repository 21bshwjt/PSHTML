To add a new HTML tag, please follow these steps:

1) Create a branch Using the tagName
2) Commit only feature additions (Use commit --amend to add bugfixes to previous commits).
3) do a pull request, and don't be offended if it is refused. It doesn't mean that your code sucks, it simply means that it doesn't fit 100% our standards
